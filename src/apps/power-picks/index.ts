// NOTE: Use this file to export any elements in power-picks that are needed in other parts of the application.
// This should not happen often, as the power-picks should be a standalone app that is only concerned with its own functionality.
// If you find yourself needing to import something from power-picks in another part of the application,
// consider if it should be moved to a more global location.
// example:
// export { default as InstantWinApp } from './app';

export { default as PowerPicksLayout } from './layout';
